<h3>What is the Phenotype Portal?</h3> 
<br />
<p> 
Phenotyping is the process of identifying a cohort of patients based on certain diseases, 
symptoms or clinical findings. The Phenotype Portal is a tool funded by the SHARPn Project from the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC).  
It will enable clinicians and investigators to identify patient cohorts using electronic health record (EHR) data by leveraging informatics-based 
phenotyping processes.  In turn, these cohorts will facilitate clinical trial enrollment, outcomes research, and inform clinical decision support.  
Currently, the field has various barriers in technological research and tool development, and Phenotype Portal is the first such platform for 
generating and executing Meaningful Use standards-based phenotyping algorithms that can be shared across multiple institutions and investigators.

<p>
Traditionally, a patient's medical information is stored inconsistently and in multiple locations, both electronically and non-electronically. 
The Phenotype Portal will work towards creating a unified framework for normalizing and standardizing clinical data, which will allow for the 
exchange of patient information among care providers, government agencies, insurers and other stake holders.
